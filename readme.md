## Problem Statement
**Title:** Creating a Stateless Widget with Images and Text

### Description:
This Flutter application demonstrates how to:
1. Display a title at the top of the page: **"My First Project"** using an `AppBar`.
2. Add two images:
   - **One image** loaded from the projectâ€™s asset files.
   - **One image** loaded from the internet.
3. Place the images in the same row with a gap between them.
4. Below the images, display a text: **"The two images are displayed"** with customizations:
   - Font size: **25**
   - Font family: **Suwannaphum-Regular**
   - Text color: **#F89999** 
   - Make the text bold.
5. Center the images and text on the page.
